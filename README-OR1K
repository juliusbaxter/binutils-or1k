			or1k binutils port README
			=========================

After several years of the OpenRISC 1000 (or1k) binutils port being in a state
of semi-completeness the time has come for it to get organised.

What was in the binutils release as of version 2.22 was two targets, openrisc 
and or32.

The openrisc target was a CGEN-based version that was, as far as I could tell,
not complete and not used. The or32 target was a strangely-named port for 
32-bit or1k implementations.

As neither of these were adequate solutions, this "new" port aims to right the
wrongs and provide a single, coherent OpenRISC 1000 binutils implementation.

For arguments against the previous tool chain triplet naming (or32-*-*) see
this post on OpenCores: http://opencores.org/forum,OpenRISC,0,3478

* Building
==========

Just make a build directory and an install directory and away you go:

     $ mkdir ../bld-binutils && cd ../bld-binutils
     $ sudo mkdir /opt/or1k-toolchain && sudo chmod a+rwx /opt/or1k-toolchain
     $ ../binutils/configure --target=or1k-elf --prefix=/opt/or1k-toolchain
     $ make
     $ make install

This will just give you the assembler and other basics.

* Regenerating CGEN input
=========================

The files generated by CGEN go in the opcodes/ directory and are all prefixed 
with "or1k-".

Regenerating these, if developing the CGEN description files can be done as 
follows:

1. Link the cgen directory into the git checkout's directory, so it's along 
   side binutils/ opcodes/ etc.
  $ ln -s ~/path/to/cgen cgen
2. Create a directory to build binutils in, so something like :
  $ cd ../
  $ mkdir bld-binutils && cd bld-binutils
3. Configure binutils to build for or1k
  $ ../binutils-or1k/configure --target=or1k-elf
4. Make the opcodes build directory appear
  $ make configure-opcodes
  $ cd opcodes
5. Edit "Makefile" so that the CGEN_CPUS variable just has "or1k" in it (or 
   don't, but this saves time)
6. Kick off the scripts to create the new or1k files.
  $ make run-cgen-all

You should see something like:

    Canonicalizing instruction semantics ...
    Done canonicalization.
    Analyzing instruction set ...
    Performing sanity checks ...
    Done analysis.
    Generating or1k-desc.h ...
    Generating or1k-desc.c ...
    Generating or1k-opc.h ...
    Generating or1k-opc.c ...
    Generating or1k-ibld.in ...
    Generating or1k-asm.in ...
    Generating or1k-dis.in ...
    Generating or1k-opinst.c ...
    touch stamp-or1k

Then you are done.

Annoyingly, if you plan on building everything in  binutils, you have to unlink
the cgen directory out of the binutils source directory otherwise it will break
halfway through the compile as it tries to do a configure and make in cgen. 
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, though...

It is possible to manually re-generate these or1k-* files, though, using
the script binutils/opcodes/cgen.sh and it's likely this is the easier way to 
do it, but this longer way is how I do it for now.
